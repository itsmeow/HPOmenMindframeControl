## More info

Tested and functional with Mindframe and Mindframe Prime headsets. If you get driver errors, try restarting your computer and ensure the headset is plugged in. Also try installing their software first (may be required to get drivers)

Supports having one Mindframe and one Mindframe Prime connected simultaneously, however you will not be able to use the Audio section (HP's own software has this limitation as well, except it doesn't hide the Audio tab).

**Windows Smartscreen may block the exe.** Hit "More info" and press "Run anyway" to get around it.
